# C3-Python-Intro
This is a little python project to introduce C3 participants to the python programming language. Nothing major just a fun little number guessing game.

What we want to try to accomplish with this is to
1. Learn how to use git to clone a repository
2. Learn some basic python syntax
3. Update this code to make it run
4. Make some improvements like
    1. Check user input for validity
    2. Offer the user the chance to play again upon successfully guessing a number
    3. Refactor the guessing logic into its own function to make it testable
    4. Bonus extra: use python's built in unit testing framework, unittest, to write some unit tests. [This site](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-unit-testing-in-python/) has a nice write up on how to do it.
